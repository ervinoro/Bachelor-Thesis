\todo{copied from abstract}Full system image replacement, like what was used on ESTCube-1 \cite{Tarbe2013,Suenter2016}, consumes large amounts of bandwidth and is, therefore, not viable very frequently. Virtual machine or script interpretator based systems have also been implemented for satellites like on TTÜ100 \cite{Aasavaeli2017} and ESTCube-1 \cite{Ehrpais2016}, but these lack the performance of native code and are, therefore, not usable for performance critical functionality. Approaches based on binary differences, like the one that was used on Mars exploration rovers \cite{Greco2005}, combine low bandwidth requirements with native performance, but require rewriting of entire firmware image, which is problematic, since ESTCube-2 on-board computer stores firmware on flash memory with large erase blocks and limited number of write cycles \cite{Haljaste2017}. To overcome these shortcomings, different systems, like StrandMind \cite{Bridges2013}, SenSpire OS \cite{Dong2009}, and Contiki \cite{Dunkels2006}, have implemented different schemes for dynamically loading modules, but the operating system for ESTCube-2 on board computer, FreeRTOS, does not support dynamically loaded software components out of the box \cite{Barry2005}. \todo{this list is not exchaustive}


The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
\TODO{What you are doing in each section (a sentence or two per section)}

Tip: if it's hard for you to start writing, then try to split it to smaller parts, e.g. if the title is ``Type Inference for a Cryptographic Protocol Prover Tool'' then the ``What is it'' can be divided into ``what is type inference'', ``what is cryptographic protocol'' and ``what is the prover tool''. These three can also be split to smaller parts etc.

\subsection{ESTCube-2}

ESTCube-2 is an experimental three-unit CubeSat. Its main missions are testing tether module for blasma brake deorbiting (previous versions of which have flown on the satellites ESTCube-1 and Aalto-1), Earth observation camera system (which is based on the \gls{eseo} camera), high speed C-band downlink system, and a novel miniaturized (up to 0.6 units) satellite bus. Other payloads include cold gas propulsion module by NanoSpace, and thin film protective coating experiment by Captain Corrosion OÜ. The ESTCube-2 mission is also planned to serve as an in-orbit demonstration of the platform, which could then be employed on future missions. \cite{Iakubivskyi2016}

ESTCube-2 is developed mostly by the students of University of Tartu and students that join the ESTCube program from all over the world \cite{Ehrpais2016}. Also among main objectives for ESTCube-2 is to educate a new generation of space engineers, and to promote space technologies in general \cite{Iakubivskyi2016}.

The \gls{obc} of the satellite is tasked with running \gls{aocs} algorithms, controlling payload experiments and startracker, and handling telemetry and telecommands. The most important requirements for \gls{aocs} are set by E-Sail and Earth observation payloads. The former needs sufficient enough angular momentum for the centrifugal deployment of the tether, and the latter requires accurate pointing. While some methods, like the use of magnetic torquers, build upon the heritage of successful ESTCube-1 mission, others, like reaction wheels by Hyperion Technologies and in-house developed \gls{fpga}-based startracker, are completely new for the team. Due to the large amount of experimental code, it is planned that it should be possible to perform firmware updates on all of the \gls{mcu}s after the launch of the satellite. This enables the team to correct any unexpected problems that the satellite may encounter. \cite{Ehrpais2016}

  Title                    = {Scripting Engine for Execution of Experimental Scripts on {TTÜ} Nanosatellite},
  Abstract                 = {Main subject for this thesis is choosing a scripting engine for TTÜ (Tallinna Tehnikaülikool) nanosatellite. The scripting engine must provide functionality, like logging, system debugging, determination, and perform certain tasks, like communicating with the bus, file writing and reading. The engine’s language must be powerful enough to fill our needs, yet small and simple enough to have as small flash and RAM (Random Access Memory) footprint as possible.

The scripting engine should also be implemented on an external board (STM32f3discovery). This way the engine’s flash footprint, RAM footprint and performance can be tested in our conditions.

The outcome was that, both Pawn and My-Basic were implemented on the external board. The flash and RAM footprint tests along with performance tests were executed and results
were analysed.

This thesis is written in English and is 38 pages long, including 5 chapters, 6 figures and 2 tables.},

  Abstract                 = {The CubeSat standard has inspired a new wave of engineers, researchers, and scientists – all aiming to utilise „commercial off-the-shelf‟ (COTS) subsystems to build nanosatellite systems. For this same reason, students and staff at Surrey have been designing a 3U CubeSat with the intention of providing low-level design, build and test experience for early career engineers, provide on-orbit demonstration of key technologies in attitude and orbit control systems (AOCS), and finally assess smart-phone components for future spacecraft applications. The modern smart-phone is the latest in a consumer driven and start-of-the-art electronics market which the STRaND-1 mission aims to exploit; assessing hardware components and exploring software towards new methods in designing and operating new satellites. The „Surrey Training, Research and Nanosatellite Demonstrator‟ is the first in a line of ambitious missions which aims to strengthen the ties between Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL). The project began in April 2010 where STRaND-1 was designed in the team‟s free time but the major build work began in mid-October 2012. Launched on 25 February 2013, the assembly, integration and test (AIT) phase took approximately 4 months to complete. This paper discusses this phase and the typical-CubeSat subsystems and non-PC/104 AOCS and computing payloads in a custom payload bay. In-orbit results of the new nanosatellite power, attitude and orbit control system are presented. With many new capabilities to demonstrate on STRaND-1 when in-orbit, exploiting the latest consumer electronics and software with real training and mission utility was disruptive. We evaluate the ground-based operational processes during commissioning.},

  Abstract                 = {From experience with wireless sensor networks it has become apparent that dynamic reprogramming of the sensor nodes is a useful feature. The resource constraints in terms of energy, memory, and processing power make sensor network reprogramming a challenging task. Many different mechanisms for reprogramming sensor nodes have been developed ranging from full image replacement to virtual machines.We have implemented an in-situ run-time dynamic linker and loader that use the standard ELF object file format. We show that run-time dynamic linking is an effective method for reprogramming even resource constrained wireless sensor nodes. To evaluate our dynamic linking mechanism we have implemented an application-specific virtual machine and a Java virtual machine and compare the energy cost of the different linking and execution models. We measure the energy consumption and execution time overhead on real hardware to quantify the energy costs for dynamic linkin.Our results suggest that while in general the overhead of a virtual machine is high, a combination of native code and virtual machine code provide good energy efficiency. Dynamic run-time linking can be used to update the native code, even in heterogeneous networks.},

mission is to test Coulomb drag propulsion. Coulomb drag can be used in Low-Earth Orbit by 
deploying and charging a tether that is used to brake the orbital velocity of the satellite and reduce 
its orbital altitude. To test this concept, ESTCube-2 will deploy and charge a 300 m tether. Such a 
tether could deorbit ESTCube-2 from the altitude of 700 km to 500 km in half a year. 
Other payloads that are being considered for the ESTCube-2 satellite are an Earth observation 
camera, a C-band communications system and an experimental laser communication system. 
ESTCube-2 in-orbit demonstration platform will also be designed for other electric solar wind sail 
experiments outside of the influence of Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetic field. The satellite bus will be integrated 
into one system that could also be reused for different types of missions. The integrated system is 
developed to maximise the space for payloads on a nanosatellite. This paper presents the payloads

They must use little energy and be robust to environmental conditions, while also providing common services that make it easy to write applications. In TinyOS, the current state of the art in sensor node operating systems, reusable components implement common services, but each node runs a single statically-linked system image, making it hard to run multiple applications or incrementally update applications. We present SOS, a new operating system for mote-class sensor nodes that takes a more dynamic point on the design spectrum. SOS consists of dynamically-loaded modules and a common kernel, which implements messaging, dynamic memory, and module loading and unloading, among other services. Modules are not processes: they are scheduled cooperatively and there is no memory protection. Nevertheless, the system protects against common module bugs using techniques such as typed entry points, watchdog timers, and primitive resource garbage collection. Individual modules can be added and removed with minimal system interruption. We describe SOS's design and implementation, discuss tradeoffs, and compare it with TinyOS and with the Maté virtual machine. Our evaluation shows that despite the dynamic nature of SOS and its higher-level kernel interface, its long term total usage nearly identical to that of systems such as Matè and TinyOS.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we present the preliminary mission analysis for the ESTCube-2 three-unit CubeSat, which is designed to test Coulomb drag propulsion. One of the applications of Coulomb drag is the electric solar wind sail (E-sail), that could be used to travel within the Solar System with record speeds of up to 30 km/s, using solar wind as propellent. A second application includes the charging of a tether in low Earth orbit to decrease the orbital velocity of the satellite. The negatively charged plasma brake tether interacts with the ambient ionospheric plasma ram flow to slow down the satellite. To test this concept, ESTCube-2 will deploy a 300 m tether and subsequently charge it to 1 kV. The charged tether will be used to reduce the orbital altitude of the satellite. Such a tether could deorbit ESTCube-2 from an altitude of 700 km to 500 km in half a year. The previous ESTCube-1 and the upcoming Aalto-1 missions have shown that it is feasible to host a similar payload in 1/3 to 1/2 of a CubeSat unit. The mass of a 300 m long tether is nominally 30 grams according to conservative estimates. Hence the plasma brake is a lightweight, efficient, cost-effective, and scalable deorbiting system with a potential to address the space debris issue at critical altitudes of 900 km and less. The ESTCube-2 in-orbit demonstration platform will be designed and developed for future employment for other Coulomb drag propulsion experiments. One example is the demonstration the electric solar wind sail (E-sail) outside the Earth's magnetosphere, which would allow for the confirmation of analytical, numerical and laboratory estimations of the E-sail force. The main requirements for the satellite bus occupying 1/2 of a CubeSat unit are to provide the total angular momentum of 23 Nms for centrifugal tether deployment, to provide means of deployment verification, and to provide up to 3 W of power for charging the tether. This paper will present an overview of the requirements and performance dynamics of each subsystem housed in the miniaturized integrated bus and its payloads. In addition, consideration of systems for high spin rate will be presented.},

Therefore, they rely on simple and proven-in-use design. However, with growing software complexity, maintenance becomes very important aspect in safety domain. Recent approaches for managing maintenance allow to perform changes on software at design-time, which implies that the whole system has to be rebuilt when the application software changes. In this paper, we describe more flexible solution for updating the application software. We apply the component-based paradigm to construct the application software, i.e. we define a model of a software function that can be dynamically linked with the entire operating system (OS). In order to avoid the usage of the OS-provided support for dynamic linking, we design software functions as position-independent and relocation-free binaries with well-defined interfaces.

  Title                    = {Runtime {UI} Reloading for Java},
  Abstract                 = {In order to test if an edit works as expected, developers have to go through many routine tasks. Depending on the application given it may span from multiple seconds to minutes per change. Developer tests a change on average three to four times per hour - it is obvious that the process is excessively time-consuming. To minimize the amount of time, dynamic class updating software, like JRebel, can be used. Sadly, up to the present moment, none of the available products support reloading the UI of a running desktop application. For that reason, the aim of this thesis is to bring out the possible approaches that would enable runtime UI reloading for Swing programs. Accordingly a plugin UiReload for JRebel is implemented which can detect what was changed and therefore apply the modifications to running UI components whilst losing none of the existing state. In order to reach the expected result some major challenges had to be overcome. For a start, it was necessary to determine what was changed and which objects were affected by those editions. Secondly, to make sure how to propagate those changes to a running application. Thirdly, to ascertain how to create new instances of components and finally, how to replace an old instance of a component with new, in a way that the fresh version maintains the state of the previous one. For finding the state an automatic approach was devised. As a result, with UiReload, developers can test the changes in milliseconds. This implies to the fact that there is no more need to restart the application, navigate to the changed view nor fill in forms on the way. Overall, testing changes reaches the maximum speed and simplicity.},

The functional requirements of space systems can change over time, and unforeseen failures can affect systems performance, thereby necessitating modifications and upgrades to the on-board software. Remote software upgrades as an option, can help space systems in operation to maintain their functionality in an uncertain environment, or even take advantage of uncertainty by adding novel applications or improving functionality while in space. In this paper, the concept of increasing flexibility of space systems through software is defined and some examples are discussed. The author presents a quantitative framework for measuring the value of flexibility in space systems. A case study on a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) is presented and the value of flexibility introduced to the satellite by software upgrade is measured using the flexibility framework. The quantitative flexibility framework allows decision-makers to assess the extent of software flexibility their space systems can exhibit in the face of uncertainty.},

There are plenty of proposed solutions for various existing programming languages, but typically the solutions target a specific language and are not reusable. In this thesis, we explored how the Truffle language implementation framework could aid language creators in adding reloading capabilities to their languages. We created a reusable reloading core that different Truffle-based languages can hook into to support dynamic updates with minimum amount of effort on their part. We demonstrate how the Truffle implementations of Python, Ruby and JavaScript can be made reloadable with the developed solution. With Truffle’s just-in-time compiler enabled, our solution incurs close to zero overhead on steady-state performance. This approach significantly reduces the effort required to add dynamic update support for existing and future languages.},

However, embedded environments are usually resource-limited in terms of memory size, processing power, power consumption, and network bandwidth. Thus, dynamic update for embedded operating systems should be designed to make the best use of limited resources. In this paper, a server-side pre-linking mechanism is proposed to make dynamic updates of embedded operating system efficiently. Applying this mechanism can reduce not only memory usage and CPU processing time for dynamic update, but also data transmission size for updated components. Power consumption can be reduced as well. We have implemented this mechanism in LyraOS which is a component-based embedded operating system. Performance evaluation shows that the size of updated components applying the proposed },

  Abstract                 = {Symbol relocation is very important for program linking and execution. For modern operating systems in PC, symbol relocation process is completed by static linking or dynamic linking. For the execution of Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file in Linux, dynamic linker will resolve symbols at runtime. However, many embedded operating systems inhibit supporting dynamic linking of ELF file, which results in the symbol relocation is not successful. In this paper, we proposed a code self-relocation method. This method doesn't need extra support from operating system, and the whole relocation process is finished by code in the program. We relocate the entry in Global Offset Table (GOT) and the pointer in structure. This method is evaluated in a program with 37 source files. The result shows that all the entries in GOT and pointers in structure have been relocated to the absolute address, and the symbol relocation is successful. It proves that the method is simple but effective for the developer.},
